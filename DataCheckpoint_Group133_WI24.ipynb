    "Participating in extracurricular activities while balancing school can be challenging. Student-athletes generally have a busier schedule than most students. They have to juggle and coordinate their training schedules, assignment deadlines, class attendance, and more. We recognize that the academic workload on STEM majors is generally more extensive than non-STEM majors. Given this, we wanted to explore whether or not academic pursuits correlate with athletic performance. Specifically, we aim to investigate if there are differences in performance between STEM and non-STEM majors at UCSD given its heavy STEM influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a study that investigates the relationship between athletic identity and the selection of academic majors among college student-athletes, they found that students who care more about sports generally choose a major with decreased academic rigor. Based on the findings from this study, we can assume that there is likely a positive correlation between athletic performance and non-STEM majors at UCSD. This correlation suggests that high-performing student-athletes might lean towards majors that offer more flexibility and less academic pressure. This allows them to manage their training and game schedules more effectively. Students who prioritize their sports success are more likely to choose a major that aligns and simply helps them meet the academic requirements. This assumption should be consistent across all genders.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we wanted to study how athletes' physical measurements such as their height and weight affect their performance. In further research, we looked into gender differences in terms of physical variances. Men are generally considered more powerful and have more strength compared to women because they have larger muscle mass and lower body fat. Also, men are taller and have longer limbs compared to women. With all this considered, men have a physical advantage in sports where strength and height are used. Despite efforts to promote gender equality in sports, these biological differences continue to shape athletic outcomes. Given that men generally have greater physical strength, height, and muscle mass compared to women, it is reasonable to assume that these differences may influence athletic performance outcomes, especially in sports that heavily rely on strength and height.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding on prior research, our study intends to explore multifaceted connections between athletic performance, physical attributes (height/weight), and academic preferences among those participating in basketball, soccer, volleyball, and water polo. We aim to investigate how these variables interrelate with performance rates across genders at UCSD. By analyzing these relationships, we aim to identify which factors most strongly correlate with higher athletic performance among male and female student-athletes at UCSD.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Our team hypothesizes that at UCSD, student-athletes from non-STEM fields and those with advantageous physical measurements (notably greater height and weight) tend to show enhanced sports performance, irrespective of gender. This pattern is anticipated due to the lower academic workload associated with non-STEM disciplines, allowing for more intensive training, and the natural advantage provided by superior physical attributes in athletic activities. We expect these relationships to be consistent across both male and female athletes, suggesting that the impact of academic interests and physical measurements on sports performance does not vary significantly by gender."

Nowhere in UCSD’s athletics website’s Terms of Service (which is run by SIDEARM Sports) or in any other of UCSD’s websites does it prohibit the use of this publicly available data. Furthermore, we have reached out to and met with UCSD Athletics to discuss our project. In our meeting with them, we ensured our practices were ethical and data used was accurate. The data used in our analysis is quantitative, directly from UCSD, thus there will be no room for personal biases. A few sports lacked the factors necessary for our analysis, so we have omitted them, only using complete data. Additionally, we will omit the names of athletes in our project as it is irreverent to the task we seek to accomplish.\n",

    "An unintended consequence of our analysis may be our audience’s interpretation of our results negatively impacting their choice of university. If the audience views the factors we have deemed significant as unfit or unrealistic for them and their college experiences, then they may opt for another university elsewhere. Even those who attend UCSD may find the results to be negatively impactful to their emotional wellbeing if they do not believe they fit any of the factors found to be significant, therefore ruining their dreams of playing college sports.\n",

    "Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about these unintended consequences. While we would love for there to be no potential negative effects our analysis may cause, these unintended consequences are ultimately based on our audience’s interpretation of our results and are therefore out of our control."
